# Rebuild RFCs
[Rebuild RFCs]: #rebuild-rfcs

This project should collect all the theoretical background and experience of the Rebuild Language project.

# Project Details
[Project Details]: #project-details

You may want to start with our [mission statement](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/00001-mission.md)

The [Wiki](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/wiki) collects knowledge and hints from other projects and languages.
For example the [Existing system language survey](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/wiki/Existing-system-language-survey) and some motivating [Use Cases](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/wiki/Use-Case-Collection).

# RFC papers
[RFC papers]: #rfc-papers

The current goal is to collect ideas, knowledge and experience with crazy ideas.
So all ideas are just collected as [pull requests](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/pulls).
We value all your ideas and comments.

Please read the [HowTo](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/blob/master/Readme.md). This document explains the idea and patterns for the RFC process.

# Experimental Compiler
[Experimental Compiler]: #experimental-compiler

We also need experience wit the proposed ideas. So we started an experimental compiler that implements some of the RFCs suggested here.
Feel free to take a look [REC](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/REC) at the project.
If you want to start hacking this is the place for you.
