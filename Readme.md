# Rebuild RFCs
[Rebuild RFCs]: #rebuild-rfcs

## Please read the [pull requests](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs/pulls)!

All intentions to change the user experience of rebuild should get feedback of 
the community before they are implemented.

The "request for comments" (RFC) process is designed to provide this feedback 
and produce a consensus in the community.

## Before creating an RFC
[Before creating an RFC]: #before-creating-an-rfc

A hastily-proposed RFC can hurt its chances of acceptance. Low quality 
proposals, proposals for previously-rejected features, or those that don't fit 
into the near-term roadmap, may be quickly rejected, which can be demotivating 
for the unprepared contributor. Laying some groundwork ahead of the RFC can 
make the process smoother.

Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is 
generally a good idea to pursue feedback from other project developers 
beforehand, to ascertain that the RFC may be desirable: having a consistent 
impact on the project requires concerted effort toward consensus-building.

The most common preparations for writing and submitting an RFC include talking 
the idea with other community members, filing and discusssing ideas on the 
[RFC issue tracker][issues].

As a rule of thumb, receiving encouraging feedback from long-standing project 
developers, and particularly members of the relevant [sub-team] is a good 
indication that the RFC is worth pursuing.

## What the process is
[What the process is]: #what-the-process-is

In short, to get a major feature added to Rebuild, one must first get the RFC 
merged into the RFC repo as a markdown file. At that point the RFC is 'active' 
and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into Rebuild.

* Fork the RFC repo http://github.com/rebuild-lang/RFCs
* Copy `00000-template.md` to `text/00000-my-feature.md` (where 'my-feature'
  is descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet).
* Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present 
  convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the impact of the 
  design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be 
  poorly-received.
* Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design 
  feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to
  revise it in response.
* Each pull request will be labeled with the most relevant [sub-team].
* Each sub-team triages its RFC PRs. The sub-team will will either close the 
  PR (for RFCs that clearly will not be accepted) or assign it a *shepherd*. 
  The shepherd is a trusted developer who is familiar with the RFC process, 
  who will help to move the RFC forward, and ensure that the right people see 
  and review it.
* Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are 
  much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any 
  comments. The shepherd assigned to your RFC should help you get feedback 
  from Rebuild developers as well.
* The shepherd may schedule meetings with the author and/or relevant 
  stakeholders to discuss the issues in greater detail.
* The sub-team will discuss the RFC PR, as much as possible in the comment 
  thread of the PR itself. Offline discussion will be summarized on the PR 
  comment thread.
* Once both proponents and opponents have clarified and defended positions and
  the conversation has settled, the RFC will enter its *final comment period* (
  FCP). This is a final opportunity for the community to comment on the PR and 
  is a reminder for all members of the sub-team to be aware of the RFC.
* The FCP lasts one week. It may be extended if consensus between sub-team 
  members cannot be reached. At the end of the FCP,  the [sub-team] will 
  either accept the RFC by merging the pull request, assigning the RFC a 
  number (corresponding to the pull request number), at which point the RFC is 
  'active', or reject it by closing the pull request. How exactly the sub-team 
  decide on an RFC is up to the sub-team.


## The role of the shepherd
[The role of the shepherd]: #the-role-of-the-shepherd

During triage, every RFC will either be closed or assigned a shepherd from the
relevant sub-team. The role of the shepherd is to move the RFC through the
process. This starts with simply reading the RFC in detail and providing
initial feedback. The shepherd should also solicit feedback from people who
are likely to have strong opinions about the RFC. When this feedback has been
incorporated and the RFC seems to be in a steady state, the shepherd and/or
sub-team leader will announce an FCP. In general, the idea here is to 
"front-load" as much of the feedback as possible before the point where we 
actually reach a decision - by the end of the FCP, the decision on whether or 
not to accept the RFC should usually be obvious from the RFC discussion 
thread. On occasion, there may not be consensus but discussion has stalled. In 
this case, the relevant team will make a decision.


## The RFC life-cycle
[The RFC life-cycle]: #the-rfc-life-cycle

Once an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the 
feature as a pull request to the Rebuild repo. Being 'active' is not a rubber 
stamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately be 
merged; it does mean that in principle all the major stakeholders have agreed 
to the feature and are amenable to merging it.

Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is 'active' 
implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor 
does it imply anything about whether a Rebuild developer has been assigned the 
task of implementing the feature. While it is not *necessary* that the author 
of the RFC also write the implementation, it is by far the most effective way 
to see an RFC through to completion: authors should not expect that other 
project developers will take on responsibility for implementing their accepted 
feature.

Modifications to active RFC's can be done in follow-up PR's. We strive to 
write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the 
feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every 
merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the 
next major release.

In general, once accepted, RFCs should not be substantially changed. Only very 
minor changes should be submitted as amendments. More substantial changes 
should be new RFCs, with a note added to the original RFC.


## Reviewing RFC's
[Reviewing RFC's]: #reviewing-rfcs

While the RFC PR is up, the shepherd may schedule meetings with the author and/
or relevant stakeholders to discuss the issues in greater detail, and in some 
cases the topic may be discussed at a sub-team meeting. In either case a 
summary from the meeting will be posted back to the RFC pull request.

A sub-team makes final decisions about RFCs after the benefits and drawbacks 
are well understood. These decisions can be made at any time, but the sub-team 
will regularly issue decisions. When a decision is made, the RFC PR will 
either be merged or closed. In either case, if the reasoning is not clear from 
the discussion in thread, the sub-team will add a comment describing the 
rationale for the decision.


## Implementing an RFC
[Implementing an RFC]: #implementing-an-rfc

Some accepted RFC's represent vital features that need to be implemented right 
away. Other accepted RFC's can represent features that can wait until some 
arbitrary developer feels like doing the work. Every accepted RFC has an 
associated issue tracking its implementation in the Rebuild repository; thus 
that associated issue can be assigned a priority via the triage process that 
the team uses for all issues in the Rebuild repository. 

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC 
author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for 
review after the RFC has been accepted.

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an 'active' RFC, 
but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to 
ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).


## RFC Postponement
[RFC Postponement]: #rfc-postponement

Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the 'postponed' label when they are 
closed (as part of the rejection process). An RFC closed with “postponed” is 
marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal 
nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, 
and we believe that we can afford to wait until then to do so. Postponed PRs 
may be re-opened when the time is right. We don't have any formal process for 
that, you should ask members of the relevant sub-team.

Usually an RFC pull request marked as “postponed” has already passed an 
informal first round of evaluation, namely the round of “do we think we would 
ever possibly consider making this change, as outlined in the RFC pull 
request, or some semi-obvious variation of it.”  (When the answer to the 
latter question is “no”, then the appropriate response is to close the RFC, 
not postpone it.)


### Help this is all too informal!
[Help this is all too informal!]: #help-this-is-all-too-informal

The process is intended to be as lightweight as reasonable for the present 
circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let the process be driven by 
consensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.
